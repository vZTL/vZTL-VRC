<u><b>1.1 Update Explanations:</b></u>


<b>ATL Class Bravo Airspace:</b><br>
The Radar Vectoring Map of the new Atlanta Class Bravo airspace has been added while the old map has been removed.

<b>AIRAC from 1113 to 1303:</b><br>
The number of Fixes and Airways have been greatly reduced to improve loading time of the sector file.

<b>POF:</b><br>
We now have a POF file for each terminal radar facility. Positions and Position symbols have been added.

<b>Notice of closing towers on 4/7/2013:</b><br>
More will come on this as we approach this date in another forum thread.


<b>Fixed Visibility Centers for all towers:</b><br>
Similar to issues such as this one. Many seem to forget to set there visibility center when they first load vZTL VRC. I recently found a way to correct this issue and now the visibility center loads directly over the primary airport for each profile.


<b>Reduced Visibility Range:</b><br>
It also became noticeable that many who logged in as a ground controller neglected to reset their visibility range to 20nm or less as required by the VATSIM COC. Plenty of our controllers got pinged by VATSIM supervisors to reduce their range. I have now set all ranges for tower profiles to 20nm. This will insure everyone is automatically in compliance with the COC but you still have the option to increase.
